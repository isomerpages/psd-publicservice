<p><strong>How do I check my application status?</strong>

<p><strong>When will I get a response for my job application?</strong>
</p>
<p>Agencies review all job applications received and will contact shortlisted
candidates for interviews. All applicants will generally be notified on
whether they are shortlisted or not within 4-6 weeks of the closing date
of the job posting or by the date specified in the job posting.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Do I need to send in my curriculum vitae/resume/copies of my educational qualifications after submitting my online application?</strong>
</p>
<p>You do not need to send in any of the above documents at the point of
application, unless the ministry has requested for these documents to be
attached upfront. You will be asked to bring along your relevant documents
when the ministry invites you for an interview.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>I am a final-year undergraduate who will be graduating soon. Can I submit my application for any of the on-going recruitment exercises?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, you can submit your application. If you are found suitable, you may
be given a provisional offer of appointment.</p>

<p><strong>Currently I have a registered business, which does not require much involvement and I am keen to start working again. Would I qualify for a job in the Public Service?</strong>
</p>
<p>You can be considered for positions in the Public Service, as long as:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your personal activities/business do not affect or influence your performance
of your official duties;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no conflict of interest between your official duties and your
personal activities/business; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your personal activities/business will not bring the Public Service into
disrepute.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The ministry will make this assessment relative to the post that you are
being considered for. You may wish to enquire directly with the ministry
of your interest if you have further queries.</p>
