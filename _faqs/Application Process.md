<p><strong>How does the Careers@Gov site fit in my job search process?</strong>
</p>
<p>Our job portal gathers job openings across public service in one place
to facilitate your job search. After you have identified the jobs you would
like to apply for, you may be directed to the relevant systems to complete
the job application process.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>I am a final-year undergraduate who will be graduating soon. Can I submit my application for any of the on-going recruitment exercises?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, you can submit your application. If you are found suitable, you may
be given a provisional offer of appointment.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>I currently have a registered business, which does not require much involvement and I am keen to start working again. Would I qualify for a job in the Public Service?</strong>
</p>
<p>You can be considered for positions in the Public Service as long as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your personal activities/business does not affect or influence the performance
of your official duties;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no conflict of interest between your official duties and your
personal activities/business; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your personal activities/business will not bring the Public Service into
disrepute.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The agency will make this assessment based on the post that you apply
for. You may wish to enquire directly with the agency if you have further
queries.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Do I need to send in my curriculum vitae/resume/copies of my educational qualifications after submitting my online application?</strong>
</p>
<p>You do not need to send in any of the above documents at the point of
application, unless the agency has requested for these documents to be
attached upfront. You will be asked to bring along your relevant documents
when the agency invites you for an interview.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What do I do if my education or employment institution is not in the list?</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are unable to find your educational institution or employer in
the 'Name of ...' list after clicking the binocular icon, please check
the 'Didn't find what you were looking for?' box and enter your educational
institution's or employer's name.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>When will I get a response for my job application?</strong>
</p>
<p>Agencies will review all job applications and contact shortlisted candidates
for interviews. Applicants will generally be notified on whether they are
shortlisted within four to six weeks of the closing date of the job posting
or by the date specified in the job posting.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>How can I track my job applications? Is there a way to check the status of the application?</strong>
</p>
<p>The portal currently does not allow you to track your application status.
However, we are actively exploring this feature for the future. In the
meantime, we will work with agencies to encourage timely updates at each
stage of the recruitment process.</p>
