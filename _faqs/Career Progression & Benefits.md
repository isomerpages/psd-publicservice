<p><strong>Is there any difference in career progression for scholars or non-scholars?</strong>
</p>
<p>Career progression in the Public Service is based on the individual's
performance on the job, his potential to take on greater responsibilities,
and his character attributes (such as integrity, leadership and commitment).
Being a scholar does not guarantee a faster career progression. Once on
the job, officers have to prove themselves through their work performance.</p>

<p><strong>How are starting salaries determined in the Public Service?</strong>
</p>
<p>Your starting salary would be based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your credentials (such as your work experience and skills)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The demands of the job (such as the type of work and scheme of service
that you are appointed to)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prevailing labour market condition.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>How does the Civil Service ensure that pay is linked to performance?</strong>
</p>
<p>Salary components such as merit increments and performance bonuses are
tied to an officer's assessed performance. Officers who are assessed to
have performed better than their peers will receive higher merit increments
and performance bonuses. This ensures that officers' salaries are commensurate
with their contributions and abilities.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>How much and what components of Civil Service salaries are variable?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Civil Service has a flexible wage system that comprises
fixed and variable components in an officer's monthly and annual salaries.
This allows the government to respond appropriately to economic and market
conditions, and link pay to performance. The Annual Variable Component
(AVC), Merit Increment (MI) and Performance Bonus (PB) are examples of
variable salary components.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Are there any restrictions on the type of Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) that I can adopt if I am hired?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Public Service supports FWAs and has put in place various flexible
work policies to help our agencies and employees work more effectively.
FWAs refer to flexi-time (staggered work hours), flexi-place (telecommuting)
and flexi-load (part-time).</p>
<p>The type of FWA that is applicable depends on the nature of your work.
For example, an officer involved in frontline counter duty may not be able
to telecommute.
<br>
<br>Public agencies are given the autonomy and flexibility to implement the
FWAs which best suit their organisational needs. The working arrangements
are worked out directly between the officers and their agencies. If you
wish to find out more about the FWAs for the post that you are interested
in, check directly with the respective agency.</p>
