<p><strong>How do I apply for internships with government agencies?</strong>
</p>
<p>You may contact public agencies directly to enquire about suitable internship
projects. Singaporean undergraduates studying at foreign universities can
be considered for internships with the agency if they fit the project requirements
(e.g. skills required for the project, internship period, etc).</p>

<p><strong>What is the difference between Ministries and Statutory Boards? Are statutory boards considered part of the Singapore Civil Service?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Public Service employs about 152,000 public officers working
in 16 Ministries and more than 50 Statutory Boards. Within the Public Service
is the Civil Service, comprising about 86,000 officers working in the Ministries.</p>
<p>Statutory boards (such as HDB, CPF Board, IRAS, etc) have their own recruitment
and human resource management practices. They are legally distinct employers
from the Civil Service.</p>
