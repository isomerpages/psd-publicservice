<p><strong>Why does the job portal look different?</strong>
</p>
<p>We have improved the portal. With our new job search, you can expect a
better browsing experience with more relevant job matches.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Where are my bookmarked jobs from the old portal?</strong>
</p>
<p>Sorry, we were not able to carry over your bookmarked jobs from the previous
portal to the new portal.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Can I bookmark jobs on the new job portal?</strong>
</p>
<p>Not at the moment, but this feature is in active deployment and will be
available soon.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What new features and enhancements will there be in the future?</strong>
</p>
<p>In upcoming updates, we plan to introduce user accounts, bookmarked jobs,
personalised job recommendations and job alerts to further enhance your
experience. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please share them
with us to help shape future improvements. We can be reached at: careers.gov.technicalhelp@psd.gov.sg.</p>
