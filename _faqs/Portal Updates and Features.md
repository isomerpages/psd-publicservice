<p><strong>Why does the job portal look different?</strong>
</p>
<p>We have improved the portal. With our new job search, you can expect a
better browsing experience with more relevant job matches.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Can I bookmark the jobs I am interested in?</strong>
</p>
<p>In Careers@Gov, you can set up a user profile or log in to your existing
one to bookmark a job that interests you. You should be able to access
your previously bookmarked jobs after you log in to the job application
portal.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What new features and enhancements will there be in the future?</strong>
</p>
<p>In upcoming updates, we plan to introduce user accounts, bookmarked jobs,
personalised job recommendations and job alerts to further enhance your
experience. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please share them
with us to help shape future improvements. We can be reached at: careers.gov.technicalhelp@psd.gov.sg.</p>
