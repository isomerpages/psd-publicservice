<p><strong>Does the Public Service accept candidates from any discipline or do I have to specialise in a particular field?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Public Service generally accepts candidates from all disciplines,
as we need a broad range of people to serve in diverse roles across the
Service. However, for positions in specialised fields such as accountancy,
legal and medical services, you will need to have a professional degree
in the relevant field of study.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Is it true that the Public Service is interested in recruiting only fresh graduates?</strong>
</p>
<p>We want to recruit outstanding talent at all job levels. We welcome both
fresh graduates and mid-career candidates who can&nbsp; provide different
perspectives, experiences and knowledge to join us. .</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Is it true that the Public Service only recruits graduates with excellent academic qualifications and/or scholars?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Public Service offers a wide range of jobs with different requirements.
We take into account a variety of factors when considering candidates for
our roles. These include relevant skills, competencies, work experience,
qualifications, and alignment with the job’s requirements.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>How do I know whether my qualification is recognised for employment to the Public Service?</strong>
</p>
<p>There is no central authority that assesses or accords recognition to
degrees for employment into the Public Service. In general, degrees from
universities accredited by the home government of the country where the
university is located will be considered for appointment into the Public
Service. This applies to degrees obtained full-time or part-time, through
distance learning or twinning programmes, etc. Each public service agency
decides on the skills and qualifications required for their respective
jobs. For overseas professional qualifications, agencies will check whether
these are recognised by the relevant professional bodies in Singapore.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What do I do if my education or employment institution is not in the list?</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are unable to find your educational institution or employer in
the 'Name of . . . .' list, after clicking the binocular icon, please check
the 'Didn't find what you were looking for?' box and enter your educational
institution's or employer's name.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Is there a minimum number of passes I need in order to declare GCE ‘A’ or ‘O’ Level as my highest educational qualification?</strong>
</p>
<p>You can declare GCE ‘A’ or ‘O’ Level as your highest educational qualification
as long as you have obtained the examination certificate. According to
the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s (SEAB) rules and regulations,
candidates will be awarded a certificate if they obtain a pass in at least
one examined subject. You may wish to visit the SEAB website for more details
and the specific pass grades for each examination level.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Is there any age criterion for applying for Public Service positions?</strong>
</p>
<p>We welcome individuals of all ages to apply for available jobs.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Can candidates with criminal records apply for positions in the Singapore Public Service?</strong>
</p>
<p>We welcome all to apply. Selection will be based on best fit for the job.
You need not declare criminal records when applying for a job in the Civil
Service</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Does the Singapore Public Service employ non-Singaporeans?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, non-Singaporeans can apply and be considered for jobs in the Public
Service. They are generally hired for non-sensitive positions that are
operational in nature or where the skills required are in shortage.</p>
