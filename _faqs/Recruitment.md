<p><strong>Does the Public Service accept candidates from any discipline or do I have to specialise in a particular field?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Public Service generally accepts candidates from all disciplines for
generalist positions. However, for positions in specialised fields such
as accountancy, legal and medical services, you will need to have a professional
degree in the relevant field of study.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Is it true that the Public Service is interested in recruiting only fresh graduates?</strong>
</p>
<p>We are interested in recruiting the best people for our jobs - be they
fresh graduates or mid-career entrants. We consider the candidate's work
experience, personalities, skills and other credentials during the selection
process.</p>
<p>We are constantly on the look-out to recruit outstanding talent at all
job levels, and we welcome mid-career candidates to share their wealth
of experience and knowledge to provide a different perspective to the job
issues and challenges.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Is it true that the Public Service only recruits graduates with excellent academic qualifications and/or scholars?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Public Service offers a wide range of jobs with different requirements.
Academic qualification is just one proxy for ability to do the job. We
take into account other important factors such as relevant work experience,
personal attributes and motivations, and commitment to public service.
For a mid-career candidate, relevant work experience is a more important
proxy than academic qualification for a good job fit.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>How do I know whether my qualification is recognised for employment to the Public Service?</strong>
</p>
<p>There is no central authority that assesses or accords recognition to
degrees for employment into the Public Service. In general, degrees from
universities accredited by the home government of the country where the
university is located will be considered for appointment into the Public
Service. This applies to degrees obtained full-time or part-time, through
distance learning or twinning programmes etc. Each public service agency
decides on the skills required for their respective jobs, and qualification
may be one proxy for the required skills. For overseas professional qualifications,
agencies will check whether these are recognised by the relevant professional
bodies in Singapore.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What do I do if my education or employment institution is not in the list?</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are unable to find your educational institution or employer in
the 'Name of . . . .' list, after clicking the binocular icon, please check
the 'Didn't find what you were looking for?' box and enter your educational
institution's or employer's name.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Is there a minimum number of passes I need in order to declare GCE ‘A’ or ‘O’ Level as my highest educational qualification?</strong>
</p>
<p>You can declare GCE ‘A’ or ‘O’ Level as your highest educational qualification
as long as you have obtained the examination certificate. According to
the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s (SEAB) rules and regulations,
candidates will be awarded a certificate if they obtain a pass in at least
one examined subject. You may wish to visit the SEAB website for more details
and the specific pass grades for each examination level.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Is there any age criterion for applying Public Service positions?</strong>
</p>
<p>Candidates of all ages are welcomed to apply for available jobs.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Can candidates with criminal records apply for positions in the Singapore Public Service?</strong>
</p>
<p>All candidates are welcomed to apply. Selection will be based on best
fit for the job. Candidates need not declare criminal records when applying
for a job in the Civil Service</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Does the Singapore Public Service employ non-Singaporeans?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, non-Singaporeans can apply and be considered for jobs in the Public
Service. Generally, they are hired for non-sensitive positions that are
operational in nature or where the skills required are in shortage</p>
