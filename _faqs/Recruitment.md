<p><strong>What is the Public Service's recruitment philosophy?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Public Service works with the Government and Singaporeans to build
a vibrant, inclusive, fair, thriving, resilient and united Singapore. To
achieve this, we seek to recruit a diverse group of people from different
backgrounds, who bring their skills, experiences and perspectives to their
jobs, and have a heart for Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Recruitment is based on merit and objective criteria of the job, through
fair and open competition. Candidates are assessed based on a holistic
review of their relevant skills, competencies, work experience and alignment
with the job's requirements.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Public Service agencies adhere to the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment
Practices. We do not discriminate candidates based on their nationality,
age, sex, marital status, pregnancy status, caregiving responsibilities,
race, religion, language, disability, and mental health conditions.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Does the Public Service accept candidates from any discipline or do I have to specialise in a particular field?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Public Service generally accepts candidates from all disciplines,
as we need a broad range of people to serve in diverse roles across the
Service. However, for positions in specialised fields such as accountancy,
legal and medical services, you will need to have a professional degree
in the relevant field of study.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Is it true that the Public Service is interested in recruiting only fresh graduates?</strong>
</p>
<p>We want to recruit outstanding talent at all job levels. We welcome both
fresh graduates and mid-career candidates who can provide different perspectives,
experiences and knowledge to join us.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Is it true that the Public Service only recruits graduates with excellent academic qualifications?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Public Service offers a wide range of jobs with different requirements.
We take into account a variety of factors when considering candidates for
our roles. These include relevant skills, competencies, work experience,
qualifications, and alignment with the job’s requirements.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>How do I know whether my qualification is recognised for employment to the Public Service?</strong>
</p>
<p>In general, degrees from universities accredited by the home government
of the country where the university is located will be considered for appointment
into the Public Service. This applies to degrees obtained full-time or
part-time, through distance learning or twinning programmes, etc. Each
public service agency decides on the skills and qualifications required
for their respective jobs. For overseas professional qualifications, agencies
will check whether these are recognised by the relevant professional bodies
in Singapore.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Is there a minimum number of passes I need in order to declare GCE ‘A’ or ‘O’ Level as my highest educational qualification?</strong>
</p>
<p>You can declare GCE ‘A’ or ‘O’ Level as your highest educational qualification
as long as you have obtained the examination certificate. According to
the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s (SEAB) rules and regulations,
candidates will be awarded a certificate if they obtain a pass in at least
one examined subject. You may wish to visit the SEAB website for more details
and the specific pass grades for each examination level.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Is there any age criterion for applying for Public Service positions?</strong>
</p>
<p>We welcome individuals of all ages to apply for available jobs.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Can candidates with criminal records apply for positions in the Singapore Public Service?</strong>
</p>
<p>We welcome all to apply. Selection will be based on best fit for the job.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Does the Singapore Public Service employ non-Singaporeans?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, non-Singaporeans can apply and be considered for jobs in the Public
Service. They are generally hired for non-sensitive positions that are
operational in nature or where the skills required are in shortage.</p>
