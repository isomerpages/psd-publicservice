<h3>We believe in nurturing talent and empowering our officers to thrive and deliver their best for Singapore and Singaporeans. We offer:</h3>
<h4><strong>Growth and development</strong></h4>
<p>We invest in our officers and help them to develop the skills and competencies
they need to make a difference today for tomorrow. We offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A diverse range of training courses, job rotation opportunities and attachment
programmes, including to the private and people sectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Career coaching and on-demand digital courses and development resources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Care for your well-being</strong></h4>
<p>We encourage a strong culture of care and support across the Public Service.
Benefit from support for your physical and mental well-being, with our
employee wellness programmes, workshops and counselling services.</p>
<p>Balance your work-life priorities with flexible work arrangements. These
include flexi-load (e.g. part time), flexi-place (e.g. telecommuting) and
flexi-time (e.g. staggered hours), subject to the operational requirements
of the role and public agency. A network of co-working spaces around Singapore
is also available for public officers to use.</p>
<h4><strong>Fair and market-competitive salaries</strong></h4>
<p>We pay salaries comparable to that of the private sector for employees
with similar competencies and responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bonuses and increments are performance-based. Annual packages include
monthly and annual salary components. Some agencies provide additional
remuneration based on the unique nature or requirements of the job. Vital
contributions are also acknowledged through recognition awards.</p>
<h4><strong>Leave benefits</strong></h4>
<p>Public officers have a wide range of leave benefits for personal and family
needs.</p>
<p>These include leave for vacation, study, volunteering, marriage, maternity
and paternity, child care and parent care, medical, and more.</p>
<h4><strong>Medical and dental benefits</strong></h4>
<p>The Public Service makes additional contributions to public officers'
Medicare accounts, on top of the normal statutory Medicare contributions.
Public officers can use this to buy MediShield or portable Medisave-approved
insurance plans to cover their inpatient needs. This ensures continued
medical coverage for public officers even after they leave Service.</p>
<h4><strong>Voluntary Group Insurance Scheme</strong></h4>
<p>Public officers can tap on preferential premium rates when buying term
insurance coverage for themselves and their dependents under the Public
Officers Group Insurance Scheme (POGIS).</p>
<p>POGIS provides coverage for death, total and partial permanent disablement,
with optional add-ons for critical illness, early critical illness, and
extended years coverage.</p>
