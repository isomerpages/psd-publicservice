<h3>We believe in nurturing talent and empowering our officers to thrive and deliver their best for Singapore and Singaporeans. We offer:</h3>
<h4><strong>Growth and development</strong></h4>
<p>We invest in our officers and help them to develop the skills and competencies
they need to make a difference today for tomorrow. We offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A diverse range of training courses, job rotation opportunities and attachment
programmes, including to the private and people sectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Career coaching and on-demand digital courses and development resources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Care for your well-being</strong></h4>
<p>We encourage a strong culture of care and support across the Public Service.
Benefit from support for your physical and mental well-being, with our
employee wellness programmes, workshops and counselling services.</p>
<p>Balance your work-life priorities with flexible work arrangements. These
include flexi-load (e.g. part time), flexi-place (e.g. telecommuting) and
flexi-time (e.g. staggered hours), subject to the operational requirements
of the role and public agency. A network of co-working spaces around Singapore
is also available for public officers to use.</p>
<h4><strong>Fair and market-competitive salaries</strong></h4>
<p>We adopt the principles of paying clean, competitive, and performance-based
wages, which include bonuses and other annual components.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We hire candidates on different schemes of service, based on the nature
of the jobs they undertake. Each scheme of service is benchmarked to the
relevant talent pools in the private sector. We provide annual merit-based
increments and, where necessary, adjust salaries to keep pace with the
market.</p>
<h4><strong>Leave benefits</strong></h4>
<p>Public officers have access to a wide range of leave benefits for personal
and family needs.</p>
<p>These include leave for vacation, study, volunteering, marriage, maternity
and paternity, child care and family care, medical, and more.</p>
<h4><strong>Medical and dental benefits</strong></h4>
<p>The Public Service makes additional contributions to public officers'
Medisave accounts, on top of the normal statutory Medisave contributions.
Public officers can use this to buy MediShield Life or portable Medisave-approved
insurance plans to cover their inpatient medical needs. This is for the
benefit of public officers as it ensures continued medical coverage even
in the event that they decide to leave the Service.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Public officers also receive subsidies to offset their outpatient medical
and dental expenses.</p>
<h4><strong>Voluntary Group Insurance Scheme</strong></h4>
<p>Public officers can tap on preferential premium rates when buying term
insurance coverage for themselves and their dependants under the Public
Officers Group Insurance Scheme (POGIS).</p>
<p></p>
<p>POGIS provides coverage for death, total and partial permanent disablement,
with optional add-ons for critical illness, early critical illness, and
extended years coverage.</p>
