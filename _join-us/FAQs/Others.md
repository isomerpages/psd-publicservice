<p><strong>How do I apply for internships with government agencies?</strong>
</p>
<p>You can explore internship opportunities available on Careers@Gov (select
"Internship" under Work Type).</p>
<p>You may also contact public agencies directly to enquire about suitable
internship projects. Singaporean undergraduates studying at foreign universities
can be considered for internships with the agency if they fit the project
requirements (e.g. skills required for the project, internship period etc)</p>

<p><strong>What is the difference between Ministries and Statutory Boards? Are statutory boards considered part of the Singapore Civil Service?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Public Service employs about 150,000 public officers working
in 16 Ministries and more than 50 Statutory Boards. Within the Public Service
is the Civil Service, comprising about 86,000 officers working in the Ministries.</p>
<p>They work in various schemes of service, including the Administrative
Service, legal, education, police, civil defence and accounting schemes.
Statutory boards (such as HDB, CPF Board, IRAS, etc) have their own recruitment
and human resource management practices. They are legally distinct employers
from the Civil Service.</p>
<p>If you would like to find out more about the various statutory boards
in Singapore, you can access their websites for details.</p>
